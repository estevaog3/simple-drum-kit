# simple-drum-kit
This is a simple drum kit project that I made to begin learning Javascript. You can [play it right now on this website](https://estevaog3.github.io/simple-drum-kit/).

This project is based on the first project of the Javascript30 course, which is available at https://JavaScript30.com.

## What I learned
- How to use events and listeners in JavaScript to make the drums' sound good and the key's animation persistent.
